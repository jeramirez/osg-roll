<para>
The Rocks osg Roll uses the latest stable OSG Release
to provide High Throughput Computing environment for Rocks clusters.
The Rocks osg Roll builds on the very good work by the OSG team,
to seamlessly install and configure the <emphasis>de facto</emphasis> standard grid
middleware on Rocks Clusters.

		<para>Cluster Planning:
To understand the default value of some attributes, this &roll; roll assumes the following minimal 
partition scheme by default:
</para>

<screen>
/        (reformatted at kickstart)
/var     (reformatted at kickstart)
/scratch (a partition to host local dirs to be shared in cluster)
/hadoop  (a partition to be used by hadoop)
</screen>

<para>
For any given CE node/server, if the partition intended for local dirs to share is NOT "/scratch", 
then  it can be set by using the rocks attr "OSG_CE_Export_LocalDir" to
a desired value. 
For example we want to share local dirs located in "/export", then use:
</para>

<screen>
###global
#/opt/rocks/bin/rocks set attr OSG_CE_Export_LocalDir value="/export"
### or host specific
#/opt/rocks/bin/rocks set host attr login-0-0 OSG_CE_Export_LocalDir value="/export"
</screen>

<para>
Similarly, to change the default partition/dir used by hadoop, require change in rocks attrs OSG_HadoopDataDir and/or OSG_HadoopData.
